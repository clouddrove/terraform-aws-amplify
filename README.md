We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-amplify/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
  ```hcl
  module "amplify" {
   source = "../"
   name        = "amplify"
   environment = "test"
   label_order = ["name", "environment"]
   amplify_enabled        = true
   environment_name       = "prod"
   domain_name            = ["newloop.eu", "newloop.dk"]
   amplify_repository     =  "https://github.com/clouddrove-sandbox/terraform-aws-amplify"
   access_token           = "ghxxxxxm06Sd3KqkafBVu0xzcxcxcv0EA8AK"
   amplify_branch_name    = "main"
   sub_domain_prefix_name = "scan"
   deployment_artifacts   = "app-example-deployment"
   stack_name             = "amplify-app-example"
   branch_framework       = "React"
   branch_stage           = "PRODUCTION"
   branch_environment_variables = {
   ENV = "test"
   }
   amplify_app_environment_variables = {
   REACT_APP_API_SERVER = ""
   }
   custom_rules = [
   {
   source = "/01/<p01>/21/<p21>"
   status = "302"
   target = "/?p01=<p01>&p21=<p21> "
   }
   ]
  }
  ```

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
